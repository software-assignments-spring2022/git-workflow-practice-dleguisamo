### DeepMind's AI Programming Tool Tests in Top 54% of Human Coders

Overall, I found this article to be very intersting because it hightlights a perspective regarding careers in computer science that I don't think about very often. When I chose to study computer science, I was excited at the prospect of having a very wide variety of options for what I could with my degree after graduation. It also felt like a very safe option, considering the growth the industry has been experiencing in recent years. 
However, this article was a reminder of quickly the industry itself is evolving to accommodate goals such as AI programming tools. Although the article describes the ways in which AI programming tools fall short when compared to humans, I can't help but wonder how long it will be until those challenges are overcome. How might a 'human level' AI programming tool affect the industry?

I agree with the sentiment that this is a facinating article. it showcases how rapidly the technologies utilized in the field of computer science are evolving and shaping the landscape of this field. What we all think is standard practice or necessary might later become automated. Many industries have been facing these changes over the years, and its clear that programming is no exception. This article makes me think back to a quote on the syllabus by Alan Turing:

> "The masters [programmers] are liable to get replaced because as soon as any technique becomes at all stereotyped it becomes possible to devise a [program] which will enable the electronic computer to do it for itself. It may happen however that the masters will refuse to do this. They may be unwilling to let their jobs be stolen from them in this way. In that case they would surround the whole of their work with mystery and make excuses, couched in well chosen gibberish, whenever any dangerous suggestions were made."

This article seems like its a prime example of what Turing was refering to, or rather how the industry isn't falling for the selfpreserving misguidedness that Turing warns of. Current industry professionals could easily remain content with the industry, but instead are developing better technologies, even if it makes certain skills valued in this profession obsolete.
